Longer fermentation allows for more complex flavors to develop due to the extended activity of yeast and bacteria, which produce various organic acids and alcohols. This results in a richer, more nuanced taste. Additionally, extended fermentation improves the texture by allowing gluten to develop more fully, leading to a chewier and more elastic crumb. Conversely, shorter fermentation times may result in a milder flavor and a denser, less developed texture.",
