      "response": "Mountain weathering and erosion are processes that break down and reshape mountains over time. Weathering involves the breakdown of rocks at the Earth's surface through physical, chemical, and biological means. Physical weathering includes freeze-thaw cycles and thermal expansion, while chemical weathering involves reactions with water, oxygen, and acids. Biological weathering is caused by plants and microorganisms.\n\nErosion is the removal and transportation of weathered material by natural agents such as water, wind, ice, and gravity. Rivers and streams carve valleys and transport sediments, glaciers grind down rock surfaces, wind carries away fine particles, and gravity causes rockfalls and landslides.",

      "response": "River terraces play a significant role in landform development by providing evidence of past river activity and changes in environmental conditions. They are step-like landforms that form along the sides of valleys, representing former riverbeds that have been abandoned as the river cuts downward into its valley. This process can occur due to changes in sea level, tectonic uplift, variations in sediment supply, or climatic changes. River terraces help in understanding the geological history of an area, the evolution of river systems, and the processes of erosion and sediment deposition.",

      "response": "Glacial movements create crevasses and seracs through the process of differential motion within the glacier. As a glacier flows over uneven terrain or around obstacles, the ice experiences varying stress and strain. This causes the brittle upper layer of the glacier to crack, forming crevasses. Seracs are formed when blocks of ice are isolated by intersecting crevasses, often in areas of steep gradient or where the glacier flows over a drop-off.",

Demerara sugar, with its molasses content, adds a rich, caramel-like flavor and a slightly grainy texture. Turbinado sugar, also containing molasses but less processed than white sugar, imparts a mild caramel flavor and a bit of crunch. These variations can enhance the complexity and depth of the cocktail, complementing the rum and other ingredients.",
